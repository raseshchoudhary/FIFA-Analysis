I have analyzed the players in this FIFA dataset to scout the best players for my team. If you are into football and want to know who are the current best players in different abilities such as defense, tackel, attack, dribbling and goal keeping then this the project you should definately look at. Lastly in this project I have done a messi vs ronaldo to gauge who is the better among the two, spoiler alert its Messi!!!.

# About the dataset.

The dataset contains information on football (soccer) players from the FIFA 19 video game. It includes 18,207 records, each with 89 attributes, and is organized into various columns, including player URL, short name, long name, positions played, overall rating, potential rating, value in euros, weekly wage in euros, age, height, weight, nationality, and club.

The attributes captured for each player include both physical and skill-based characteristics, such as acceleration, sprint speed, dribbling, shooting, defending, and goalkeeping. Additionally, the dataset contains information on each player's contract status, release clause, and international reputation.

Also in this project I am action as person who has been hired by Real Madrid to scout the best possible players for them.

>Let us now look at some key insights from the visuaizations.

1.Reputation of the players is in direct correlation with their earnings. Meaning that the more reputed you the more you earn. However, players who have a score of 5 are being paid less than the ones who are rated 4 lets look at the possible reason.

2.Most of the high paid players are between the age range 25 to 35, This could mean that as the players get older their performace starts to dwindle and the players who are extemenly young are juveniles and they need to learn more. But the players who are 25-25 years of age are young as well as experienced so they are in more demand hence the high salary.

3.Gianluigi Donnarumma has the best reflexes, handling and diving and is the 4th best in goal kicking. Undoubtedly he is the best option available and the most complete player. However incase we are not able to cast him into our lot, we have another budding player M. Maignan who is in the top 3 in all the parameters except for speed. So my picks would be either of these two but preferably Gianluigi Donnarumma.

4.Since we have planned to hire the best in every field its a no brainer that we'll be paying a hefty sum to such players, we now need to focus on the money as well.Based on the graphs we should go for E. Halland as he is top notch in the attack finishing, although we have other players as well but they are too expensive give the amount of money we will already be paying to other top players.

Overall L.Messi is the best active football player followed by Levandowski and CR7
